Checks commit with php-cs-fixer, cancels commit if codings standards are not correct.

This is an attempt to improve https://github.com/LilaConcepts/LilaConceptsBestPracticeBundle/blob/master/hooks/pre-commit-cs-fixer.
It checks files staged for commit, rather than working copy.

INSTALL
=======
Simply copy pre-commit file to .git/hooks/ directory root and make it executable.

CONFIGURATION
=============
In order to modyfy cs-fixer configuration place .php_cs file in your project root. For more configuration options refer to: https://github.com/fabpot/PHP-CS-Fixer
